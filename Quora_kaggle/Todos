1. Basic RFR/XGBoost model
  > q1 and q2 size
  > q1 and q2 number of words without stemming
  > q1 and q2 number of words with stemming
  > q1 and q2 nouns, verbs
  > TF IDF sum of all words ?
  > TF IDF model of all words ? >> mainly to filter out random questions in the test set ?
  > q1 and q2 find the "focal word" ---> TF IDF ? Eg: Geology, astronomy, 
    > Cluster the questions --> find distinace from all clusters
  > Regularization
  > TF IDF change normalizations
  > see nltk features, sentiment etc.
  > train, dev and test
  > Xgboost svm knn rfr compare reaults... kitchen sink ... find which model can predict what type of questions, visualize
  
  
 2. Deep Model/Tensor Flow
  > Train an ANN with inputs as q1 and q2 word vectors [3 or 5 main important vecotrs, identify using TF-IDF]
  > Classify using a simple deep learning model
  > See if features from 1. can be reused
  > Use word vectors for w2v, glove and facebook see kaggle thread
  > see 224d for more advanced ideas like Named entity recognition
  
  
 3. Model on top of 1 and 2 ?
